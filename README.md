## Description

This project is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

Inputs required for this application are:

* Project title
* Description
* Installation
* Usage
* License
* Contributors
* Tests

Based on the user's input, a README.md file is generated and the license badge is added to the README.md file if one is selected.
